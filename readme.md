# SP500 Price Prediction Using Machine Learning üöÄ

This README outlines the process of predicting S&P 500 index movements using Python, specifically with the `yfinance` package for data retrieval and `sklearn` for machine learning.

## Overview üìà

The script fetches historical price data of the S&P 500 index, processes it to prepare for machine learning, and uses a Random Forest Classifier to predict whether the index's price will go up or down the next day.

### Steps Involved üõ†Ô∏è

1. **Data Retrieval**: Using `yfinance` to download the S&P 500 price history.
2. **Data Preparation**: Processing the data to format it for machine learning, including removing unnecessary columns and shifting prices to set up a target variable.
3. **Feature Selection**: Selecting relevant features such as Close, Volume, Open, High, and Low prices for the prediction model.
4. **Model Training**: Training a Random Forest Classifier with specified parameters to predict the index movement.
5. **Prediction & Evaluation**: Making predictions on test data and evaluating the model's accuracy using the precision score.

### Key Concepts üóùÔ∏è

- **Historical Data**: Utilizing all available data since 1990 to account for various market conditions.
- **Random Forest Classifier**: An ensemble learning method for classification that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees.
- **Precision Score**: A metric to evaluate the accuracy of the positive predictions made by the model.

### Improving Accuracy üéØ

The script provides a foundation for predicting stock market movements. However, the precision score indicates there's room for improvement.Can experiment with adding more predictors, adjusting model parameters, or trying different machine learning algorithms to enhance prediction accuracy.
